# The Dangers of Being Lawful Good or: How I Killed the Azure Portal Desktop App and Why Microsoft Never Said a Word
## Intro
Microsoft has been in the news a lot recently, and rightfully so. With various vulnerabilities popping up (some they knew and some they didn't), it's been a rough go for them. With all of that going on, I was reminded of a finding I made last year. At the time, they didn't do anything to address it. Imagine my surprise when after reviewing the last 12 months of Release Notes and Security Bulletins I didn't see any announcements for it either. At the time, I knew it was a serious issue but was told it wasn't and suddenly it disappeared and isn't available to download anymore. Because I was still new in the area, instead of publishing my finding like I am now, I reached out to multiple outlets for help. Either no one responded or said they would look into it and then never said anything again. When I mentioned my frustrations to someone, I was asked why I hadn't published anything on my own. They were understanding of my doubts, but encouraged me to do it anyway. I realized my imposter syndome and my apparent Lawful Good alignment had gotten in the way of me making this issue known. And here we are.

If you are only interested in the vulnerability, please see the tl;dr at the end of this post.

tl;dr The AzurePortalInstaller.exe is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking. There is no fix for it and it must be removed from your computers manually and any download of the exe blocked.
