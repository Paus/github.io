# The Dangers of Being Lawful Good or: How I Killed the Azure Portal Desktop App and No One Ever Told You
## The Intro
Microsoft has been in the news a lot recently, and rightfully so. With various vulnerabilities popping up (some they knew and some they didn't), it's been a rough go for them. With all of that going on, I was reminded of a finding I made last year. At the time, they didn't do anything to address it. Imagine my surprise when after reviewing the last 12 months of Release Notes and Security Bulletins I didn't see any announcements for it either. At the time, I knew it was a serious issue but was told it wasn't and suddenly it disappeared and isn't available to download anymore. Because I was still new in the area, instead of publishing my finding like I am now, I reached out to multiple outlets for help. Either no one responded or said they would look into it and then never said anything again. When I mentioned my frustrations to someone, I was asked why I hadn't published anything on my own. They were understanding of my doubts, but encouraged me to do it anyway. I realized my imposter syndome and my apparent Lawful Good alignment had gotten in the way of me making this issue known. And here we are.

If you are only interested in the vulnerability, please see the tl;dr at the end of this post.

## The Culprit
The Azure Portal Desktop App was released by Microsoft in 2019.[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.jorgebernhardt.com/how-to-install-the-azure-portal-app-for-windows/) The App mainly provided users with a way of accessing the portal without having to use a browser. The exe for the App could easily be downloaded directly from the web at [https://portal.azure.com/App/Download](https://portal.azure.com/App/Download) and allowed users "to securely connect (without the use of a browser) to the Azure Port from any kind of Management server, or from a Windows client which has restrictions to use any kind of browser."[<sup>2</sup>](https://wmatthyssen.com/2020/01/02/download-and-install-the-azure-portal-app-with-powershell/)

## The Background
In August of 2022, I got COVID and was isolated from family and friends. However, my home office is in the basement meaning I still had access to my computer. Until then, I had been studying for a cert prior to getting sick. One night when the coughing and fever was keeping me awake, I stared at the ceiling and went over what I'd been learning and thinking about how it could be applied. One of the things that popped in my head was DLL Hijacking.

"DLL Hijacking is a method of injecting malicious code into an application by exploiting the way some Windows applications search and load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL)."[<sup>3</sup>](https://upguard.com/blog/dll-hijacking) DLL Hijacking was the vulnerability behind the 2020 US Federal Government Data Breach, referred to at the time as the worst cyber attack in US history.[<sup>4</sup>](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/cyber-attack-may-be-worst-hacking-case-in-the-history-of-america-2223270/) [<sup>5</sup>](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/18/orion-hack-solarwinds-explainer-us-government) The third party, SolarWinds, announced the vulnerability and provided ways to remediate the issue through a [blog post](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/12/advanced-cyber-attack-hits-private-and-public-sector-via-supply-chain-software-update) and an [FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20201216112302/https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory/faq). Additional Information on this specific instance can be found [here](https://www.newsweek.com/solarwinds-russia-hack-cyberattack-fireeye-software-malware-backdoor-cybersecurity-1554730) and [here](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/cyber-attack-may-be-worst-hacking-case-in-the-history-of-america-2223270/).

I began thinking about different desktop apps I use that might be vulnerable. Since I couldn't get to sleep, I pulled myself out of bed and sat down at my computer and began testing these different apps. I tested a lot of them with no luck before I was finally able to sleep. The next morning I returned to my computer and started testing again. It was then that I found the Azure Portal Desktop App (AzurePortalInstaller.exe) was vulnerable to DLL. More importantly, I knew there was no way to just push an update to everyone.

## The Vulnerability
Because the app is by Microsoft and is "trusted" by default, the installation process can be started and completed without requiring Admin permissions. Downloads of the file are more likely to be ignored unless, for example, a company uses AWS instead of Azure, and can be explained away. The attack occurs just before installation of the App is completed. It's worth mentioning that while testing showed the installation can be stopped, it was not easy to accomplish.

Once access has been established, the attacker needs a way for the shell to reactivate in the event the computer is shutdown. This can be accomplished with the Task Scheduler. A "basic" task that activates when the victim logs in can be created without any elevated privileges. A malicious actor can create a basic task and have it activate the installer every time the user logs in. In my testing, the user never sees the event occur. Nothing pops up and there is no indication to the victim that something unusual has happened.

More importantly, to terminate access to the computer, a user must completely log out of the computer or shut it down. If they Ctrl+Alt+Del and lock it, the access is persistent and the attacker can continue their activities and perform actions the user may have noticed.

If the user is already an admin, the basic task can be upgraded to occur at boot instead of at login. However, if the user is not, persistence after locking a device can allow a malicious actor to identify privilege escalation opportunities or perforrm social engineering to convince an admin to active the installer and upgrade their status.

## The Submission
On August 20th, 2022, I submitted my finding to Microsoft via the [Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc), who assigned it VULN-072213 with case number 73945. My submission included most of what you read above along with the files required to execute this attack. These files included the dll file that allows the attack to occur and screenshots demonstrating the attack itself. (Please note I have opted not to include those with this post to avoid providing malicious actors with the information they need to execute this attack. Should Microsoft wish to make an announcement, they will provide you with the information they deem necessary.)

## The Response
The issue was acknowledged on August 22nd and significant back-and-forth occurred with the Security team. The conclusion from the security individual was that DLL issues are the responsibility of the individual organizations and no further communication from the team to my follow-ups was received. At the time, I believed they would just provide an announcement to their customers that this was possible and encourage everyone to remove the exe. Because I had not identified an issue like this nor worked with an organization as large as Microsoft, I figured this was how it was done. Then I began pursuing the steps I mentioned in the Intro to this post.

## The Fix
The "fix" put in place by Microsoft was to remove the App from online. No announcement was made. No posts saying they were ending support of the App. It just disappearerd. According to sites such as web.archive.org, the 302 redirect begins to appear in March.[<sup>6</sup>](https://web.archive.org/web/20230901000000*/https://portal.azure.com/App/Download) The closest to an announcement I was able to find was that beginning in September/October users were prompted to switch to the Portal Web App instead.[<sup>7</sup>](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/y83yex/azure_portal_uninstaller/) A user on Reddit made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/12dl3ui/anyone_know_where_the_azure_portal_desktop_app/) in early April asking for the location and noting that no announcements were provided by Microsoft as to its demise.

As of this writing, the vulnerability could not be exploited in the Downloads folder (which is the folder I identified and mentioned originally to Microsoft), but can still be executed in other areas the user has write permissions (e.g., Documents, Desktop).

## The Lesson Learned
My biggest takeaway from this experience has been the dangers of being Lawful Good. By reporting the issue responsibly and then remaining silent once the issue was dismissed and then quietly hidden, I allowed organizations around the world to remain at risk to a vulnerability with a nasty history. This is not my first experience with an organization acting this way about a finding. An unnamed company had a repository of thousands of driver's licenses and passports publicly available and, after I reported it, quickly locked it down and ghosted me. Both actions could alienate researchers and lead to dangerous outcomes.

Companies, both large and small, should be mindful of this and ensure they react fairly when these types of findings are provided.

## The tl;dr
The AzurePortalInstaller.exe is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking. The official URL for downloading the app has been removed, but there is no fix for existing downloads. It must be removed from your computers manually and any future downloads of the exe blocked. As of this writing, the vulnerability is still exploitable in folders where a user has write permissions excluding the Downloads folder.
